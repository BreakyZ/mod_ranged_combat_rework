# Battle Brothers Rework Close Combat Archer

Small mod aiming to rework close combat archer so it doesn't make your ranged bros completely useless when shooting at range. Throwers will have their range reduced to 3, but receive a smaller bonus when firing at a range of 3. Other ranged bros will receive debuffs which increase with range and a hitchance per tile reduction.
